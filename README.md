# AutoCommit
Do you want does fat commit stats?? then you are in the right place!

# This is how to use this repo:
download the repo as a ```.zip``` file, do not clone!
in github, click on your profile > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic) and create a token with the permissions to commit and push to private repo,
then copy the token and save it somewhere.
now back to the code, unzip the ```.zip``` file and open the project, then share the project on github to create your own repo, now open terminal in the project directory
and run this code ```git remote set-url origin https://<TOKEN>@github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO NAME>.git``` its basically your repo url but put the token before the github.com
now you are good to go, run the Main class, and boom! you are a fullstack dev now!!!
